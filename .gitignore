# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~
# Ignore all
*
#
# Unignore all with extensions
!*.*
#
# Unignore all dirs
!*/
#
### Above combination will ignore all files without extension ###
#
*.o

# Ignore `bin` dir
bin/
# or
*/bin/*
